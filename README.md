## Description
For my project, I decided to make a small minigame to test my skills with pygame. The program is a timed game where the player starts off in a dark area where the ground gives away to a hole. Once the player falls down that hole, the real game begins and a health bar sits at the top left corner of the screen. The player’s task is to collect the food sources scattered throughout the small map and reach the goal before the health bar depletes itself completely. The game uses the left and right arrow keys for movement and the up arrow for jumping.

To achieve the visuals for this game, I drew all of the assets that currently sit alongside the Python file so the code could take my images and draw it onto the program instead of going through the tedious process of having my code draw everything out. I wanted to have a title screen and a win/lose outcome screen as well, so I took the time to draw each icon, button, background and cover illustrations to give it the effect of a fully functioning game.

After completing this project, in terms of design, I believe more detail could have been added to either the props or even the character animations to make it seem less simple. I also think the level map could have been much longer, due to it only taking a few seconds to complete the adjective with how short it currently is. The problem that might have possibly been the cause for this is the massive learning curve required to carry out this project. Aside from my current knowledge from the class, there was a lot to learn about, concerning character animations, the various functions to move the character, to interact with objects and setting the gravity so the character wouldn’t float. If I were to do this again, I would make sure to shorten my expectations and create a much more realistic proposal that wouldn’t demand too much, with the time given. Another issue I struggled with during this project was committing. Despite committing being incredibly important for saving progress and testing code, I became far too accustomed to VSC saving everything even when I turned off my laptop, which resulted in there being no progress recorded until I actually began to commit a week before the due date.
